### 👋 Hello there!

I'm Sergio, a code-wielding Software Engineering on a mission to protect the digital galaxy from the dark forces of bugs and spaghetti code. Hailing from Tatooine 🪐, I'm fueled by a passion for coding and a love for all things Star Wars.

#### 🌌 Journey to the Light Side of Coding

- 🚀 Currently guarding the stars at Dixper as a Senior Front end developer.
- 🔧 Mastered the ways of the Force in [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), but always working with other technologies like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
- 🪐 Currently navigating the [![Three.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Three.js-%23000000.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=three.js&logoColor=white)](https://threejs.org/) galaxy, learning the art of 3D sorcery to bring immersive experiences to the digital realm. Join me on this cosmic journey! 
- 🌱 Always learning, because even Jedi Masters need to keep up with the evolving tech universe.
